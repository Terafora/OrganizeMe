# OrganizeMe

## About

OrganizeMe is a todo list application made for setting tasks and prioritising them.

The goal of this project was to put into practice what I've learned about PHP and implement it with MySQL as well as not use additional styling frameworks.


### Home

- This is where the main dashboard is and where your notes/todos live.
- The notes are coloured by priority which is manually set upon creation and can be editted by the user.
- From here users can also delete their notes/todos which they have completed of no longer need.
- Users are also able to select a button to create a new button.

### Form

- This is where notes/todos can be created and edited by the user.
- Each note/todo has required fields and is automatically set a unique ID and default status of incomplete.

## Technologies

- PHP 
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- MySQL

## Design

Due to the short time frame imposed on the project and this being my first time making a project with PHP and dusting off my knowledge of MySQL after almost a decade I decided to keep the design fairly basic and straight forward to allow for easier designing for multiple screens, especially as I would not be using any frameworks such as BootStrap or Tailwind.

Basic colours were used for each card to indicate priority quickly and efficiently to users while being too saturarted so that the contents of cards/todos could be easily read.

## Features

- This app is fully CRUD capable so it can:

    - Create new notes/todos.

    - Display notes/todos.
    
    - Edit notes/todos.

    - Delete notes/todos.

### Still To Come

Due to the time limit I wasnn't able to implement the following:

    - Todo status
        - I wasn't able to quite get this working just yet, but I began creating the code to make it so a pending and complete status would show on each card. As user's can delete these it's not critical to the functionality but is a nice to have I'd like to continue working on.

    - Automatically Changing Priority Levels On Cards
        - This wasn't started however I would be interested in making it so cards would automatically change priority level so that users would have more of a heads up on task deadlines.

## Testing

- Minor tests were run on site to make sure.
    - Forms ran correctly.
    - Actions ran correctly (CRUD functionality)
    - Layouts displayed correctly on each page.
